# BTQuickie

Quickly access bluetooth devices on Windows 11!

**Windows + K** no longer enables you to connect to your favorite BT devices with ease... But this mini-app aims to solve the problem!

## Current Behavior

* Opens minmized in tray
* Always minimizes to tray when clicking '_'
* Click the primary mouse button on the tray icon for a quick overview of devices
* Automatically returns to tray if focus is lost
* Close application by clicking the X like you normally would
* No context menu on when secondary-clicking the tray icon

## Current Flaws

* Disconnect doesn't work properly
* Can only establish connection to some bluetooth devices 
* The time it takes to connect to a bluetooth device is slightly faster using Windows' built-in bluetooth interface

## Current Goals

*  Keyboard shortcuts for ease of access (take that Windows 11!)
*  More compatible bluetooth devices


## Third-party packages
