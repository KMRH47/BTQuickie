# BTQuickie

### Update 25/04/2022

Still working on it! Next update includes:

- A Context menu when right-clicking the taskbar icon (exit via context menu)
- Settings view...
- And the ability to change the default keybind!

Quickly access bluetooth devices on Windows 11!

**Windows + K** no longer enables you to connect to your favorite BT devices with ease... But this mini-app aims to solve the problem!

## Current Flaws

* Disconnect doesn't work properly
* Can only establish connection to some bluetooth devices 
* The time it takes to connect to a bluetooth device is slightly faster using Windows' built-in bluetooth interface

## Current Goals

*  Fix all flaws
*  Ability to change default keybinding (WIN+SHIFT+K)


## Third-party packages

**Big thanks to all the amazing people sharing their code for free, you're my idols!**
