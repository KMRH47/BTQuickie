# BTQuickie

Windows 11 no longer allows its useres to quickly access Bluetooth devices using **Windows + K**, but this mini-app aims to solve the problem!

**Requires you to pair your device first using Windows' native Bluetooth settings, as BTQuickie only lists paired devices.**

Please don't heistate to post issues as this app can be somewhat unsatisfactory in its current state. ðŸ˜Š
