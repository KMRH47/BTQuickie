# BTQuickie

Quickly access bluetooth devices on Windows 11!

**Windows + K** no longer enables you to connect to your favorite BT devices with ease... But this mini-app aims to solve the problem!

## Current Flaws

* Disconnect doesn't work properly
* Can only establish connection to some bluetooth devices 
* The time it takes to connect to a bluetooth device is slightly faster using Windows' built-in bluetooth interface
