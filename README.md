# BTQuickie

Windows + K** no longer enables you to connect to your favorite BT devices with ease... But this mini-app aims to solve the problem!
**Requires you to pair your device first using Windows' native Bluetooth settings, as BTQuickie only lists paired devices.**

Please don't heistate to post issues as this app can be somewhat unsatisfactory in its current state. ðŸ˜Š
