# BTQuickie

## KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS NOT ADDED YET

Quickly access bluetooth devices on Windows 11!

**Windows + K** no longer enables you to connect to your favorite BT devices with ease... But this mini-app aims to solve the problem!

**Planned additions:**

- Keyboard shortcut support for quick access
- Run as tray icon
- Stylish animations

## Third-party packages

**Big thanks to all the amazing people sharing their code for free, you're my idols!**
